      Skipping for now, because I am not really a fan of the yaml examples in the documentation. 
      They always require a lot of tuning for your own setup and always just look complicated.
      Since the entities offered by this integration are rather straightforward,
      I don't see much value in adding yaml automation examples, you can easily use the UI nowadays.
      Having the use-cases section to inspire people is way more useful, I like that one.
      (it seems even some Platinum integrations don't have this section?)

      Not entirely convinced splitting up entities by type is that useful. 
      As a user I think I am more interested in what functionality is supported for my device,
      rather than which exact entity types are created.
      Splitting up by control/configuration/diagnostic might be more useful.

      This implies a complete rewrite of the communication library and integration. That is a lot of work. Does not seem worth the effort right now, so probably not going to happen.
